"""Sequence input/output as SeqRecord objects.

Bio.SeqIO is also documented at U{http://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO} and by
a whole chapter in our tutorial:
 - U{http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html}
 - U{http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf}  

Input
=====
The main function is Bio.SeqIO.parse(...) which takes an input file handle,
and format string.  This returns an iterator giving SeqRecord objects:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> handle = open("Fasta/f002", "rU")
    >>> for record in SeqIO.parse(handle, "fasta"):
    ...     print record.id, len(record)
    gi|1348912|gb|G26680|G26680 633
    gi|1348917|gb|G26685|G26685 413
    gi|1592936|gb|G29385|G29385 471
    >>> handle.close()

Note that the parse() function will all invoke the relevant parser for the
format with its default settings.  You may want more control, in which case
you need to create a format specific sequence iterator directly.

Input - Single Records
======================
If you expect your file to contain one-and-only-one record, then we provide
the following 'helper' function which will return a single SeqRecord, or
raise an exception if there are no records or more than one record:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> handle = open("Fasta/f001", "rU")
    >>> record = SeqIO.read(handle, "fasta")
    >>> handle.close()
    >>> print record.id, len(record)
    gi|3318709|pdb|1A91| 79

This style is useful when you expect a single record only (and would
consider multiple records an error).  For example, when dealing with GenBank
files for bacterial genomes or chromosomes, there is normally only a single
record.  Alternatively, use this with a handle when download a single record
from the internet.

However, if you just want the first record from a file containing multiple
record, use the iterator's next() method:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> handle = open("Fasta/f002", "rU")
    >>> record = SeqIO.parse(handle, "fasta").next()
    >>> handle.close()
    >>> print record.id, len(record)
    gi|1348912|gb|G26680|G26680 633

The above code will work as long as the file contains at least one record.
Note that if there is more than one record, the remaining records will be
silently ignored.


Input - Multiple Records
========================
For non-interlaced files (e.g. Fasta, GenBank, EMBL) with multiple records
using a sequence iterator can save you a lot of memory (RAM).  There is
less benefit for interlaced file formats (e.g. most multiple alignment file
formats).  However, an iterator only lets you access the records one by one.

If you want random access to the records by number, turn this into a list:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> handle = open("Fasta/f002", "rU")
    >>> records = list(SeqIO.parse(handle, "fasta"))
    >>> handle.close()
    >>> print records[1].id
    gi|1348917|gb|G26685|G26685

If you want random access to the records by a key such as the record id,
turn the iterator into a dictionary:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> handle = open("Fasta/f002", "rU")
    >>> record_dict = SeqIO.to_dict(SeqIO.parse(handle, "fasta"))
    >>> handle.close()
    >>> len(record_dict)
    3
    >>> print len(record_dict["gi|1348917|gb|G26685|G26685"])
    413

However, using list() or the to_dict() function will load all the records
into memory at once, and therefore is not possible on very large files.
Instead, for *some* file formats Bio.SeqIO provides an indexing approach
providing dictionary like access to any record. For example,

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> record_dict = SeqIO.index("Fasta/f002", "fasta")
    >>> len(record_dict)
    3
    >>> print len(record_dict["gi|1348917|gb|G26685|G26685"])
    413

Many but not all of the supported input file formats can be indexed like
this. For example "ace", "embl", "fasta", "fastq", "genbank", "ig", "phd",
"pir", "tab" and "qual" work, but alignment formats like "phylip", "clustalw"
and "nexus" will not.

Input - Alignments
==================
You can read in alignment files as Alignment objects using Bio.AlignIO.
Alternatively, reading in an alignment file format via Bio.SeqIO will give
you a SeqRecord for each row of each alignment:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> handle = open("Clustalw/hedgehog.aln", "rU")
    >>> for record in SeqIO.parse(handle, "clustal"):
    ...     print record.id, len(record)
    gi|167877390|gb|EDS40773.1| 447
    gi|167234445|ref|NP_001107837. 447
    gi|74100009|gb|AAZ99217.1| 447
    gi|13990994|dbj|BAA33523.2| 447
    gi|56122354|gb|AAV74328.1| 447
    >>> handle.close()

Output
======
Use the function Bio.SeqIO.write(...), which takes a complete set of
SeqRecord objects (either as a list, or an iterator), an output file handle
and of course the file format::

    from Bio import SeqIO
    records = ...
    handle = open("example.faa", "w")
    SeqIO.write(records, handle, "fasta")
    handle.close()

In general, you are expected to call this function once (with all your
records) and then close the file handle.

Output - Advanced
=================
The effect of calling write() multiple times on a single file will vary
depending on the file format, and is best avoided unless you have a strong
reason to do so.

Trying this for certain alignment formats (e.g. phylip, clustal, stockholm)
would have the effect of concatenating several multiple sequence alignments
together.  Such files are created by the PHYLIP suite of programs for
bootstrap analysis.

For sequential files formats (e.g. fasta, genbank) each "record block" holds
a single sequence.  For these files it would probably be safe to call
write() multiple times.

Conversion
==========
The Bio.SeqIO.convert(...) function allows an easy interface for simple
file format conversions. Additionally, it may use file format specific
optimisations so this should be the fastest way too.

In general however, you can combine the Bio.SeqIO.parse(...) function with the
Bio.SeqIO.write(...) function for sequence file conversion. Using generator
expressions provides a memory efficient way to perform filtering or other
extra operations as part of the process.

File Formats
============
When specifying the file format, use lowercase strings.  The same format
names are also used in Bio.AlignIO and include the following:

 - ace     - Reads the contig sequences from an ACE assembly file.
 - embl    - The EMBL flat file format. Uses Bio.GenBank internally.
 - fasta   - The generic sequence file format where each record starts with
             an identifer line starting with a ">" character, followed by
             lines of sequence.
 - fastq   - A "FASTA like" format used by Sanger which also stores PHRED
             sequence quality values (with an ASCII offset of 33).
 - fastq-sanger - An alias for "fastq" for consistency with BioPerl and EMBOSS
 - fastq-solexa - Original Solexa/Illumnia variant of the FASTQ format which
             encodes Solexa quality scores (not PHRED quality scores) with an
             ASCII offset of 64.
 - fastq-illumina - Solexa/Illumnia 1.3+ variant of the FASTQ format which
             encodes PHRED quality scores with an ASCII offset of 64 (not 33).
 - genbank - The GenBank or GenPept flat file format.
 - gb      - An alias for "genbank", for consistency with NCBI Entrez Utilities
 - ig      - The IntelliGenetics file format, apparently the same as the
             MASE alignment format.
 - phd     - Output from PHRED, used by PHRAP and CONSED for input.
 - pir     - A "FASTA like" format introduced by the National Biomedical
             Research Foundation (NBRF) for the Protein Information Resource
             (PIR) database, now part of UniProt.
 - swiss   - Plain text Swiss-Prot aka UniProt format.
 - tab     - Simple two column tab separated sequence files, where each
             line holds a record's identifier and sequence. For example,
             this is used as by Aligent's eArray software when saving
             microarray probes in a minimal tab delimited text file.
 - qual    - A "FASTA like" format holding PHRED quality values from
             sequencing DNA, but no actual sequences (usually provided
             in separate FASTA files).

Note that while Bio.SeqIO can read all the above file formats, it cannot
write to all of them.

You can also use any file format supported by Bio.AlignIO, such as "nexus",
"phlip" and "stockholm", which gives you access to the individual sequences
making up each alignment as SeqRecords.

"""
FAO BioPython Developers
========================
The way I envision this SeqIO system working as that for any sequence file
format we have an iterator that returns SeqRecord objects.

This also applies to interlaced fileformats (like clustal - although that
is now handled via Bio.AlignIO instead) where the file cannot be read record
by record.  You should still return an iterator, even if the implementation
could just as easily return a list.

These file format specific sequence iterators may be implemented as:
* Classes which take a handle for __init__ and provide the __iter__ method
* Functions that take a handle, and return an iterator object
* Generator functions that take a handle, and yield SeqRecord objects

It is then trivial to turn this iterator into a list of SeqRecord objects,
an in memory dictionary, or a multiple sequence alignment object.

For building the dictionary by default the id propery of each SeqRecord is
used as the key.  You should always populate the id property, and it should
be unique in most cases. For some file formats the accession number is a good
choice.  If the file itself contains ambiguous identifiers, don't try and
dis-ambiguate them - return them as is.

When adding a new file format, please use the same lower case format name
as BioPerl, or if they have not defined one, try the names used by EMBOSS.

    Example usage, defaulting to using the record.id as key:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> handle = open("GenBank/cor6_6.gb", "rU")
    >>> format = "genbank"
    >>> id_dict = SeqIO.to_dict(SeqIO.parse(handle, format))
    >>> print sorted(id_dict.keys())
    ['AF297471.1', 'AJ237582.1', 'L31939.1', 'M81224.1', 'X55053.1', 'X62281.1']
    >>> print id_dict["L31939.1"].description
    Brassica rapa (clone bif72) kin mRNA, complete cds.

    A more complex example, using the key_function argument in order to
    use a sequence checksum as the dictionary key:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> from Bio.SeqUtils.CheckSum import seguid
    >>> handle = open("GenBank/cor6_6.gb", "rU")
    >>> format = "genbank"
    >>> seguid_dict = SeqIO.to_dict(SeqIO.parse(handle, format),
    ...               key_function = lambda rec : seguid(rec.seq))
    >>> for key, record in sorted(seguid_dict.iteritems()):
    ...     print key, record.id
    /wQvmrl87QWcm9llO4/efg23Vgg AJ237582.1
    BUg6YxXSKWEcFFH0L08JzaLGhQs L31939.1

    uVEYeAQSV5EDQOnFoeMmVea+Oow AF297471.1

    This approach is not suitable for very large sets of sequences, as all
    the SeqRecord objects are held in memory. Instead, consider using the
    Bio.SeqIO.index() function (if it supports your particular file format).
    """    
    if key_function is None:
        key_function = lambda rec : rec.id

    d = dict()
    for record in sequences:
        key = key_function(record)

            raise ValueError("Duplicate key '%s'" % key)
        d[key] = record

def index(filename, format, alphabet=None, key_function=None):
    """Indexes a sequence file and returns a dictionary like object.

     - filename - string giving name of file to be indexed
     - format   - lower case string describing the file format
     - alphabet - optional Alphabet object, useful when the sequence type
                  cannot be automatically inferred from the file itself
                  (e.g. format="fasta" or "tab")
     - key_function - Optional callback function which when given a
                  SeqRecord identifier string should return a unique
                  key for the dictionary.
    
    This indexing function will return a dictionary like object, giving the
    SeqRecord objects as values:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> records = SeqIO.index("Quality/example.fastq", "fastq")
    >>> len(records)
    3
    >>> sorted(records.keys())
    ['EAS54_6_R1_2_1_413_324', 'EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348', 'EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792']
    >>> print records["EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792"].format("fasta")
    >EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792
    TTGGCAGGCCAAGGCCGATGGATCA
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> "EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792" in records
    True
    >>> print records.get("Missing", None)
    None

    Note that this psuedo dictionary will not support all the methods of a
    true Python dictionary, for example values() is not defined since this
    would require loading all of the records into memory at once.

    When you call the index function, it will scan through the file, noting
    the location of each record. When you access a particular record via the
    dictionary methods, the code will jump to the appropriate part of the
    file and then parse that section into a SeqRecord.

    Note that not all the input formats supported by Bio.SeqIO can be used
    with this index function. It is designed to work only with sequential
    file formats (e.g. "fasta", "gb", "fastq") and is not suitable for any
    interlaced file format (e.g. alignment formats such as "clustal").

    For small files, it may be more efficient to use an in memory Python
    dictionary, e.g.

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> records = SeqIO.to_dict(SeqIO.parse(open("Quality/example.fastq"), "fastq"))
    >>> len(records)
    3
    >>> sorted(records.keys())
    ['EAS54_6_R1_2_1_413_324', 'EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348', 'EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792']
    >>> print records["EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792"].format("fasta")
    >EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792
    TTGGCAGGCCAAGGCCGATGGATCA
    <BLANKLINE>

    As with the to_dict() function, by default the id string of each record
    is used as the key. You can specify a callback function to transform
    this (the record identifier string) into your prefered key. For example:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> def make_tuple(identifier):
    ...     parts = identifier.split("_")
    ...     return int(parts[-2]), int(parts[-1])
    >>> records = SeqIO.index("Quality/example.fastq", "fastq",
    ...                       key_function=make_tuple)
    >>> len(records)
    3
    >>> sorted(records.keys())
    [(413, 324), (443, 348), (540, 792)]
    >>> print records[(540, 792)].format("fasta")
    >EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792
    TTGGCAGGCCAAGGCCGATGGATCA
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> (540, 792) in records
    True
    >>> "EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792" in records
    False
    >>> print records.get("Missing", None)
    None

    Another common use case would be indexing an NCBI style FASTA file,
    where you might want to extract the GI number from the FASTA identifer
    to use as the dictionary key.

    Notice that unlike the to_dict() function, here the key_function does
    not get given the full SeqRecord to use to generate the key. Doing so
    would impose a severe performance penalty as it would require the file
    to be completely parsed while building the index. Right now this is
    usually avoided.
