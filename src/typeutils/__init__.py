# @brief <b>typeutils</b>: Utilities that are useful in multiple projects, and defy description.
#
# This package contains (as of now):
# \li A decorator that performs type-checking for Python functions (and instance methods).
# \li A bunch of user-defined exceptions, as Python's system errors weren't sufficient
# for my purposes.
# \li A simple XKB Wrapper sub-package, that wraps some C functions provided by the XKB library.
